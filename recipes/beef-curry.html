        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and
                turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking and stirring until
                the onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Stir in the garlic, green chiles, ginger paste, cardamom seeds, cloves, and cinnamon sticks. Cook and
                stir until the garlic begins to brown, 3 to 5 more minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Mix cumin, coriander, turmeric, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and water into the onion mixture. Simmer
                until most of the water has evaporated and the mixture has thickened.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Stir in beef chuck pieces until coated with spice mixture; simmer over medium-low heat, stirring
                occasionally, until the beef is cooked through and tender, about 1 to 1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> hours.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
