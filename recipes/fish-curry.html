    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A delicate Bengali fish curry. In Bangladesh, the best parts of a fish are often reserved as a fillet and served
        grilled, broiled, or cooked alongside a fish stew or curry containing the less attractive portions of fish. The
        contrasting texture combination is worth trying at your dinner table.

    <ul>
        <li>2 large tomatoes, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>

        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon cumin seeds</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Bring the tomatoes, cumin, turmeric, salt, and water to a boil in a four quart saucepan; reduce heat to
                medium and maintain a simmer.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook the fish in the oiled skillet until golden brown,
                2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the fish to the saucepan.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Heat a separate skillet over medium heat, and toast the mustard seeds, cumin seeds, black cumin seeds,
                fennel seeds, and fenugreek seeds until fragrant, just a few seconds. Stir the spices into the saucepan.
                Simmer until the flavors integrate, about 10 minutes more. Serve hot.
